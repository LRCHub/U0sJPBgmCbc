[00:24.79] Well I've been burning for a while,
[00:29.47] I find crimson lilies in every corner,
[00:34.20] Of my filthy mind.
[00:35.73] But I can't promise I'm alright,
[00:42.71] I can't save you baby...
[00:47.51] But you'll break,
[00:48.98] And I'll fall.
[00:50.20] And you'll kiss,
[00:51.65] And I'll crawl.
[00:52.95] And I can't fight this on my own.
[01:04.15] My broken figure up in lights,
[01:08.15] Showtime I'll,
[01:12.28] Collect myself,
[01:13.52] Don't touch me I'll be fine.
[01:15.52] But I can't promise it's alright,
[01:22.03] I can't save me baby...
[01:26.78] But you'll break,
[01:28.43] And I'll fall.
[01:29.80] And you'll kiss,
[01:31.12] And I'll crawl.
[01:32.73] And I can't fight this on my own.
[01:37.98] Though I know it's not in your way,
[01:41.07] Could you find the grace to stay?
[01:44.25] I can't fight this on my own...
[02:23.29] But you'll break,
[02:24.93] And I'll fall.
[02:26.38] And you'll kiss,
[02:27.66] And I'll crawl.
[02:29.05] And I can't fight this on my own.
[02:34.63] Though I know it's not in your way,
[02:37.55] Could you find the grace to say?
[02:40.65] I can't fight this on my own...
